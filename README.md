# DiscordBot
Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create your bot

Search and copy your token (keep it a secret)

Replace the [token](bot.py) as said and enjoy!

## Update - Permanent host
To actually achieve the chance to host your bot permanently, we will need the services of two sites: https://uptimerobot.com/ and https://repl.it/.
Pretty straight forward, upload your files to Repl.it, then make a simple python server, using Flask, then create a monitor on UptimeRobot. Both sites require no subscriptions.

# Important
A quick reminder that everything looks kinda messy. That is due to the fact that this bot is 100% experimental and designed to test some exact features.

~Better versions will be posted in the future~

# Copyright
Feel free to straight up copy fragments or the whole code, if so, feedback is expected!
